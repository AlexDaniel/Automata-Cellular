Automata::Cellular provides Perl 6 interfaces to print the output of
cellular automata to a terminal.  It is not a port of anything in Perl 5,
other than a script whose port to Perl 6 is included in ext/ca_wolfram.pl.

I have used some conventions from Stephen Wolfram's paper "Cellular
Automata" that I really like: unpacking an integer number as a transition
table, and I expect to expand on this idea.

It has been tested in Rakudo Perl.

There are some nice semantics demonstrated here.  Specifically, a Rule
understands Num, Str, and Hash context.  Thanks to all of #perl6 for
helping me grok those
